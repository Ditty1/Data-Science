ABSTRACT

TOPIC: POPULATION


In this excel project, we are evaluating the dataset of countries population from 1955 to 2020. It is taken from the KAGGLE website. The dataset contains 2503 rows and 10 columns where two of them are categorical and the rest are discrete data. A total of 139 countries information is included in this dataset. Information based on year, country, population, yearly % change, migrants, median age, fertility rate, density, country share of world population and country global rank.
In this project, we pursue a deep analysis of population and factors effecting it using excel functions like MAX (), MIN (), CORREL (), FORCAST (), pivot table, conditional formatting and different charts. From the given information we can find which country has highest and lowest population and country with highest and lowest migrants and fertility rate. By using pivot table we can analyze the difference in population and global ranking between countries. And we can find and plot the correlation between migrants and density using line chart or bar chart. Above all our main purpose is to predict the population growth of the countries in the upcoming years.
This analysis is useful for population study and regulating population in highly populated countries based on migrant rate and fertility rate.
 
CHAPTER 1

1.1	INTRODUCTION

A population is a distinct group of individuals whether that group comprises a nation or a group of people with a common characteristic. In statistics, a population is the pool of individuals  from which a statistical sample is drawn for a study. Thus, any
selection of individuals grouped together by a common feature can be said to be a population. Only an analysis of an entire population would have no standard error. It includes all the elements from the dataset and measurable characteristics of the population such as mean and standard deviation.
The population is one of the important factors which help to balance the environment; the population should in a balance with the means and resources. If the population will be balanced, then all the needs and demand of the people can be easily fulfilled, which helps to preserve the environment of the country.
Population studies help us to know how far the growth rate of the economy is keeping pace with the growth rate of population.

CHAPTER 2


2.1	DATA PREPROCESSSING

Countries population from 1955 to 2020 is a good data set in the KAGGLE website without any missing values or errors. So there was no need of preprocessing. It was perfect for our data analysis project.
Unnecessary attributes median age and countries share of world population are not included in the analysis.


2.2	METHDOLOGY

In this project, we pursue a deep analysis of population and factors effecting it using the excel functions like,
•	MIN()

•	MAX()

•	PIVOT TABLE

•	CONDITIONAL FORMATTING

•	CORREL()

•	FORECAST()

•	LINE CHART

•	BAR CHART

1.	Highlight Highest And Lowest Population

To make worksheet easier to understand and to visualize data Conditional Formatting is used. Conditional formatting is a feature in many spreadsheet applications that allows you to apply formats such as colors, icons, and data bars to a cell or range of
cells, and have that formatting change depending on the value of the cell or the value of a formula.

Formula:

•	Home Conditional Formatting new rule Click on “use a formula to determine which cells to format” type the formula of the active data cell Click format button choose fill color Click OK
This aim is applied on the population column of the dataset. For that we have to find the highest and lowest population using the maximum () and minimum () functions.
Formula:

•	Select population column conditional formatting new rule format only cell that contain format only cell with equal to select the max/min value column
format button choose fill color OK

2.	Highest And Lowest Population In 2020

This aim is done by using Sort and Filter option in Excel. The Filter tool

gives you the ability to filter a column of data within a table to isolate the key components you need. The Sorting tool allows you to sort by date, number, and alphabetic order of a range or array. Values can be sorted by one or more column. It can be done in ascending or descending order.
Formula:

•	Home Sort and Filter Select Filter optionmake changes if want

This functionality is done on the whole dataset. After sorting, we will get the data only in year-2020.
Formula:

•	Select the whole dataset Home Sort and Filter Select Filter option Select the year 2020 Enter OK

After sorting the data, find the countries with highest and lowest population using maximum () and minimum () function. By conditional formatting, highlight those countries.
Formula
•	Select population column conditional formatting new rule format only cell that contain select format only cell with equal to select the max/min value column format button choose fill color Click OK

3.	Ranking Of The Countries


To summarize, sort, reorganize, group, count data pivot table is used. A pivot table is a table of grouped values that aggregates the individual items of a more extensive table within one or more discrete categories. This summary might include
sums, average, or other statistics, which the pivot table groups together using a chosen

aggregation function applied to the grouped values. It allows us to transform columns into rows and rows into columns. Grouping of any field (column), and advanced calculations can also be done.
Formula:

•	Select the dataset Insert pivot table Under “Choose the data that you want to analyze” click “Select a table/range” In Table/Range verify the cell range 
Under “Choose where you want the pivot table report to be placed” select New worksheet/Existing worksheet select the location you want the pivot table to appear Click OK
 
This aim is applied on year, country, population, country global rank column of the dataset. By filtering the data using filter option in the pivot table, we can select a particular country. Hence it helps to know the global ranking of countries in each year separately.
Formula:

•	Select the whole dataset insert pivot table Select/Drag required columns 

select country name Click OK

To organize and represent the given data pictorial pivot chart is used.

Pivot chart: Pivot charts in excel is an in-built program tool in excel which helps to summarize selected rows and columns of data. They are like regular charts, except they display data from a PivotTable. Pivot Charts is an interactive graphical representation of the data.
Column chart are used to compare values across categories.

Formula:

•	Select any cell in your PivotTable Insert Column Chart Select any design

4.	Correlation Between Migrants And Density

This aim is done by using CORREL () function available in excel worksheet. The CORREL function returns the correlation coefficient of two cell ranges. Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related. We can use the correlation coefficient to determine the relationship between two properties. The whole purpose of using correlations in research is to figure out which variables are connected. Pictorial representation of the acquired data can be shown using charts.
Formula:

•	=CORREL(array1,array2)

This functionality is applied on the Migrants and Density column of the dataset. If the result of the relation is,
i.	1 or more Positive Correlation

ii.	0	No Correlation

iii.	-1 or less	Negative Correlation

Formula:

•	=CORREL(select migrant column, select density column) Enter

Line Charts: Line charts are used to display information that change over time. It is a graph that shows a series of data points connected by straight lines. Changes over short and long period of time can be tracked.
Formula:

•	Insert Line chart Select any design

 
5.	Correlation	Between	Fertility	Rate	And	Yearly Percentage Change

To figure out the relation between these variables CORREL () function is

used. Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related. The CORREL function returns the correlation coefficient of two cell ranges. We can use the correlation coefficient to determine the relationship between two properties.
Formula:

•	=CORREL(array1, array2)


This functionality is applied on the Fertility Rate and Yearly Percentage Change column in the dataset. If the result of the relation is,
i.	1 or more Positive Correlation

ii.	0	No Correlation

iii.	-1 or less	Negative Correlation

Formula:

•	=CORREL(Select Fertility Rate column, Select Yearly Percentage Change column) Enter
The result acquired is plotted in a line chart. It shows the relation between Fertility Rate and Yearly Percentage Change.
 
Formula:

•	Insert Line chart Select any design

Line Charts: Line charts are used to display information that change over time. It is a graph that shows a series of data points connected by straight lines. Changes over short and long period of time can be tracked.

CHAPTER 3

3.1 CONCLUSION

The purpose of this analysis was to identify the factors affecting or influencing population growth. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that Migrant Rate and Density are related to each other. If Migrant Rate increases, Density also increases and
vice versa. Similarly Fertility Rate and Yearly % Change are also inter-related. These factors can make a huge difference in the world’s population. Countries like India, China and Qatar are expected to have a population growth in the upcoming years.
According to data collected from 1955 to 2020, China has the largest population and Qatar has the lowest. In 2000, the United States was found to have the highest immigration rate. And Syria has the lowest immigration rate in 2015. Yemen had the highest fertility rate from 1985 to 1990, while Hong Kong had the lowest fertility rate in 2005.
This analysis is useful for population study and population control in high population countries.
ADVANTAGES:

•	No need for sampling( The entire population is in your dataset)

•	Your findings would be representative of the population(since your analyses are based on the population)
•	You can make reliable estimates of the population with less effort and money.

•	Less time consuming
