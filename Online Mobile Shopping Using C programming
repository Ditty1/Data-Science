CHAPTER 1

1.1	INTRODUCTION


Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the internet using a web browser or a mobile app
.consumers find a product of their interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine ,which displays the same products availability and pricing at different e-retailers.
Online stores usually enable shoppers to use "search" features to find specific models, brands or items. Online customers must have access to the Internet and a valid method of payment in order to complete a transaction, such as a credit card, debit card, or a service such as Google pay. For physical products (e.g., paperback books or clothes), the e-tailer ships the products to   the   customer;   for   digital   products,   such   as   digital   audio files of songs or software, the e-tailer usually sends the file to the customer over the Internet. The largest of these online retailing corporations are Alibaba ,Amazon.com, and eBay.
Online stores are usually available 24 hours a day, and many consumers in Western countries have Internet access both at work and at home. Other establishments such as Internet cafes, community centers and schools provide internet access as well. In contrast, visiting a conventional retail store requires travel or commuting and costs such as gas, parking, or bus tickets, and must usually take place during business hours. Other advantage of shopping online is being able to quickly seek out deals for items or services provided by many different vendors (though some local search engines do exist to help consumers locate
products for sale   in   nearby   stores).   Search   engines,   online price   comparison services and discovery shopping engines can be used to look up sellers of a particular product or service. More over online shopping is very helpful during some pandemic situations.
Anyway online shopping is very beneficial and it was very useful in the way like saving time and effort ,good discounts and low prices, and the convenience of shopping at home. Thus it makes our busy life more easier.
